    The Hamming distance between two binary integers is the number of bit positions that differs
    (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">read more about the Hamming distance on Wikipedia</a>).
    For example:
</p>
<pre>
    117 = 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
     17 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
      H = 0+1+1+0+0+1+0+0 = 3

</pre>
<p>
    You are given two positive numbers (N, M) in decimal form.
    You should calculate the Hamming distance between these two numbers in binary form.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments as integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The Hamming distance as an integer.

    <strong>Example:</strong>

<pre class="brush: python">checkio(117, 17) == 3
checkio(1, 2) == 2
checkio(16, 15) == 5</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    It's a basis for Hamming code and other linear error-correcting codes.
    The Hamming distance is also used in systematics as a measure of genetic distance.
    On a grid such as a chessboard,
    the Hamming distance is the minimum number of moves it would take a rook to move from one cell to the other.
